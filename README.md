# Credit Risk Analysis

This project aims to analyze retail loan data provided by 'LendingClub', a P2P online loan broker/dealer, and build a classifier to raise proper alerts on defaultable accounts in advance for risk management purposes.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to develop a robust credit risk assessment model that can effectively identify and flag potentially defaultable accounts before they become a significant financial burden. By leveraging the power of data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide a valuable tool for risk management in the lending industry.

## Learning Goals

Through this project, we aim to achieve the following learning goals:

1. Gain hands-on experience in all the essential steps of data analysis, including data cleaning, formatting, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and modeling.
2. Develop a deep understanding of the retail loan data and the nature of the business where the data was generated from.
3. Learn how to make reasonable adjustments to improve model performance and handle class imbalance in the dataset.
4. Acquire knowledge and skills in data preprocessing and modeling using PySpark, a powerful distributed computing framework for big data processing.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into four main sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data analysis and modeling process:

1. **Data Cleaning and Formatting (20% of the project time)**: In this section, we will handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency. We will also format the data into a suitable structure for further analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Exploration (35% of the project time)**: Here, we will preprocess the data by scaling, normalization, and encoding categorical variables. We will also perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data distribution, correlations, and potential patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering (35% of the project time)**: In this section, we will create new features based on domain knowledge and statistical analysis. We will also select the most relevant features for our predictive model.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation (10% of the project time)**: Finally, we will split the data into training and testing sets, train various machine learning models, and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics. We will also handle class imbalance using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, we expect to have:

1. A clean and preprocessed dataset ready for analysis and modeling.
2. Valuable insights into the retail loan data and the factors influencing credit risk.
3. A well-trained classifier that can effectively identify defaultable accounts in advance.
4. Improved understanding of data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, and PySpark for big data processing.
